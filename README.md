### Space Shooter Game

This repository contains a space shooter game built using Pygame. Players control a spaceship and shoot at incoming meteors while managing their shield and lives. The game features sprite-based animations, sound effects, and background music.

#### Features

- **Player Control**: Move the spaceship left and right using arrow keys and shoot with the space bar.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Encounter and shoot down various meteor sprites with randomized speed and rotation.
- **Scoring and Lives**: Track player score and lives. The game ends when the player loses all lives.
- **Animations and Sounds**: Includes explosion animations and sound effects for shooting and collisions.
- **Background Music**: Plays background music continuously throughout the game.

#### Game Mechanics

- **Player**: Controlled by arrow keys and space bar. Can shoot bullets and hide temporarily when hit.
- **Meteors**: Spawn randomly and move down the screen. They rotate and vary in speed.
- **Bullets**: Fired from the spaceship to destroy meteors.
- **Explosions**: Visual and sound effects for explosions when meteors are hit or the playerâ€™s ship is destroyed.
